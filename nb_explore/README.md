## Folder: nb_explore
This folder contains jupyter notebooks used for exploration and ad-hoc analysis. 

Recommended practices
* Keeping code readable and reproducible is always a good idea...
* ... but in this folder prioritize fast prototyping and exploration of the data. 
* A naming convention is helpful and should include the date, e.g. `testviz_20201420.ipynb`
