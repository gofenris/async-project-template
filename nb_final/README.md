## Folder: nb_final
This folder contains jupyter notebooks used for exporting finalized visualizations and analytical results. Outputs are shared externally, or the notebooks themselves may be shared. In these notebooks reproducibility is important. 

Recommended practices
* These notebooks should follow coding best practices for documentation and readability, as appropriate for the project. 
* A naming convention should indicate the scope and date, e.g. `timeseries_interactive_viz_20201428.ipynb` 
* If notebooks need to be executed in particular order, provide instructions at the top of the notebook and provide hints in the filename.
